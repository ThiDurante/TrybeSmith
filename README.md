# TrybeSmith

An app to control orders on a smith (who would say a medieval smith would have an app?)

Here we have a login function with JWT authentication, where you can insert and check orders made by users(clients). The technologies used are listed below

## Installation and use

This is quite a simple one!
All you need is node 16 || 18
You can do:

```bash
# First clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ThiDurante/trybesmith.git
# Now let's get into the folder
cd trybesmith
# It's all about docker compose
docker-compose up
# Just wait for the dependencies to be installed (around 20 seconds)
```

And the App will be working on port 3001 of the localhost!

From here you can use postman to shoot requests :)

## Screenshots

I user a pattern for commits that makes them easily readable and faster to understand changes that were made! [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

These are the commits I made while developing the project:
